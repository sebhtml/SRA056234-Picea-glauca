This is a really big sample (white spruce tree).

I believe this is really the kind of sample where the Blue Gene/Q is
helpful. The genome of the white spruce has 20 Gb and is diploid.
For a comparison, the human genome is considered large and has 3 Gb and 
is also diploid.

This is a Canadian project, so using the Blue Gene/Q for that is 
nice I think.
